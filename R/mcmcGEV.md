Function to implement a combined Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme within the context of Bayesian inference from the 3-parameter Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution.

A prior joint distribution for the parameters is postulated as: $f(\mu,\sigma,\xi)=f(\mu)f(\sigma)f(\xi)$. Each marginal is a Gaussian distribuion with zero mean and a standard deviation of 10. 

To propose new values,
