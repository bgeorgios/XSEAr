# XSEAr
XSEAr is a collection of R scripts for frequency analysis of extreme values with examples from extreme sea events. These scripts are being developed as part of my ongoing Ph.D. research on coastal flood risk and sea-level extremes; the codes published here are applicable though to extreme value analysis of any other variable(s) of interest.
