# XSEAr
XSEAr is a collection of R scripts for frequency analysis of extreme values with examples from extreme sea events. These scripts were developed as part of my ongoing Ph.D. research on coastal flood risk and sea-level extremes - the scripts are applicable though to extreme value analysis of any other variable(s) of interest. Some of these codes are used directly for my research while others for validation with existing R packages on extreme value analysis, e.g., the extRemes package.
