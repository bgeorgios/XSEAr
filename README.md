# XSEAr
XSEAr is a collection of R scripts on the frequency analysis of extreme values with examples from extreme sea events. These scripts were developed as part of my ongoing Ph.D. research on coastal flood risk and sea-level extremes - the scripts are applicable to extreme value analysis of any variable(s) of interest though.
